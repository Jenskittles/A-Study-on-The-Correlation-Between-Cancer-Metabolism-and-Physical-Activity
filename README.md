ðŸ§¬ A Study on the Correlation Between Cancer Metabolism and Physical Activity

Overview

This project explores the emerging field of exercise oncology, focusing on how different types of physical activity influence cancer metabolism. Using the Recon3D metabolic model and Python-based simulations, I investigated the effects of resistance and endurance training on cellular metabolic pathways relevant to cancer progression and recovery.

Objectives

Simulate metabolic activity under exercise conditions using Recon3D

 Compare the impact of resistance vs endurance training on cancer-related metabolic functions

Explore potential mechanisms by which physical activity supports cancer treatment and recovery


Methodology

Literature review on exercise oncology and cancer metabolism

Python-based simulation using Recon3D model

Analysis of metabolic flux changes under different exercise conditions


Tools Used

â€¢ Python
â€¢ Recon3D metabolic model
â€¢ Jupyter Notebook


Key Findings

â€¢ Resistance and endurance training influence distinct metabolic pathways
â€¢ Simulated data suggests exercise may support metabolic reprogramming in cancer contexts
â€¢ Further research is needed to validate findings and explore clinical
