Cancer is a generalized term for an intricate collection of many diseases characterised by uncontrolled division and spread of abnormal cells in the human body. Since genetic mutations in cells primarily cause cancer, research in cancer genomics is widespread. 
Genetic studies, however, cannot provide information on cellular metabolic activities, simply because the former is, in principle, qualitative while the latter is quantitative. 

This computational biology project aims to discover possible mechanistic links between physical activity specifically endurance exercise and cancer metabolism. This study involves exercise metabolomics data, the reconstructed metabolic network and data analyses.
